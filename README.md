### For all exercises:
When a link does not have an endpoint in your server send a 404 message that you create. It can be anything other than the default message.

### Exercise 1
Create a page that looks similar to 2019-03-21-cw1.png that routes to ```LOCALHOST/exercise1/[PLACEHOLDER]/[PLACEHOLDER2]```. Make the PLACEHOLDER and PLACEHOLDER2 variable replace the header and footer variables

### Exercise 2
Create a page that looks similar to 2019-03-21-cw2.png that routes to ```LOCALHOST/exercise2/[PLACEHOLDER]```. Make the PLACEHOLDER a number. If the placeholder is less than or equal to zero replace the "One" with "Less than". If the placeholder is greater than zero replace the "One" with "Greater than". 

### Exercise 3
Create a page that looks similar to 2019-03-21-cw3.png that routes to ```LOCALHOST/exercise3```.
